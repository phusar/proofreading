New Addons portal is out!
=========================

We deployed new "Addons portal":http://addons.nette.org/. Old addons have been migrated but some very old has been dropped.

New version brings new features:
- preferred way to publish an addon is as "Packagist":https://packagist.org/ package
- dependencies are loaded from `composer.json`
- description can by written in Texy! or Markdown
- multiple categories and licences can be choosed

There is an option to upload an addon package manually. It suits for client-side addons mostly.

To help disseminate Nette abroad, the only supported language of addons description is English. Well, there are still few addons by Czech so please, authors, update them.

Whole portal is "published":https://github.com/nette/web-addons.nette.org/ as opensource. It is a quite grown application written in Nette Framework. You can inspire self by it and "report  bug":https://github.com/nette/web-addons.nette.org/issues/new if you hit some.
