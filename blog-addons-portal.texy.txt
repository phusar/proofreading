New Addons portal is out!
=========================

The new "Addons portal":http://addons.nette.org/ has been deployed and the old addons have been migrated with the exception of some very old ones that have been dropped.

The new version brings new features, such as:
- preferred way to publish an addon is as "Packagist":https://packagist.org/ package
- dependencies are loaded from `composer.json`
- description can be written in Texy! or Markdown
- multiple categories and licenses can be chosen

There is an option to upload an addon package manually, which suits mostly for client-side addons.

To help disseminate Nette abroad, the only supported language of addons description is English. Well, there are still few addons in Czech so please, authors, update them.

The whole portal is "published":https://github.com/nette/web-addons.nette.org/ as open-source. It is a quite grown application written in Nette Framework. You can inspire yourself by it and "report bug":https://github.com/nette/web-addons.nette.org/issues/new if you hit some.
